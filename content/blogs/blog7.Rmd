title: Does America Approve with Trump?

```{r load-libraries, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)

I wanted to find out how many americans approve with their own president. 

To do this, I donwloaded approval polls data and manipulate the data as to allow for a thorough analysis and ultimately a plot that enables me to analyed the approval margins of Donald Trump over time. 

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('static', 'data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

glimpse(approval_polllist)


approval_polllist2 <- approval_polllist %>%
filter(subgroup == "Voters") %>% 
mutate(
  modeldate = mdy(modeldate),
  startdate = mdy(startdate),
  enddate = mdy(enddate),
  createddate = mdy(createddate),
  enddate_week = week(enddate),
  enddate_year = year(enddate),
  net_approval = approve - disapprove
  )

glimpse(approval_polllist2)
```

## Create a plot

What I will do in order to recreate this plot is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, I use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

```{r, cache=TRUE}

net_approval_ci <- approval_polllist2 %>% 
  filter(enddate_week <= 52) %>% 
  group_by(enddate_year, enddate_week) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_netapproval = mean(net_approval),
    sd_netapproval = sd(net_approval),
    count = n(), #count is too high
    se_netapproval = sd_netapproval/sqrt(count),
    margin_of_error = qt(0.975, count-1)*se_netapproval, 
    netapproval_low = mean_netapproval - margin_of_error,
    netapproval_high = mean_netapproval + margin_of_error
  )
  
    
```

Next, I create a plot to show the results.

```{r, cache=TRUE}

net_approval <- ggplot(net_approval_ci) +
  geom_line(aes(y = mean_netapproval, x = enddate_week, color = factor(enddate_year))) +
  geom_point(aes(y = mean_netapproval, x = enddate_week, color = factor(enddate_year)), size=1) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = netapproval_low, 
                  ymax = netapproval_high, 
                  x = enddate_week, 
                  fill = factor(enddate_year), alpha = 0.1,
                  show.legend = FALSE)) +
  facet_wrap(~enddate_year) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 52, by = 13)) +
  xlab("Week of the year") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-20, 7.5, by = 2.5)) +
  ylab("Average Net Approval (%)") +
  ggtitle("Does America really approve of Donal Trump?", subtitle = "Average Weekly Net Approval Margins of various polls") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold")) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, color = "orange")

net_approval
    
```

## A little Note on Comparing Confidence Intervals

When I compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020), I see the following:

```{r, cache=TRUE}

ci_comparison <- net_approval_ci %>% 
  filter(enddate_year == 2020, enddate_week == c(15, 34)) %>% 
  mutate(confidence_interval = netapproval_high - netapproval_low)

ci_comparison
```

The confidence interval for week 15 is significantly lower than the confidence interval for week 34. However, this is not due to a change in sample size, but rather because the standard deviation of net approval rates in week 34 is significantly higher than the standard deviation of net approval rates in week 15. One could assume that the week from the 17th to the 23rd was very eventful especially with regards to Corona and hence, there was a more significant divide amongst democrats and republicans or in other words, Trump approvals and non approvals. This probably led to a higher standard deviation and thus the margin of error in our calculation is significantly higher for week 34 than for week 15.
