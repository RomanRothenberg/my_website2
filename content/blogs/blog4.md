## My Life in a few Words


**1. The Beginnings**

My name is Roman Rothenberg and I was born on the 16th of September 1998 in Frankfurt, Germany. I don't recall much of my early days, but the first memory I have is playing *Field Hockey*. I began playing Field Hockey when I was 3 years old. I don't actually know whether one could call it Field Hockey what I was doing back then, but it sometimes involved hitting a ball with a stick, so I assume the description matches the sport in some way. I began playing in Frankfurt and played there for almost 15 years. 

**2. Sport and School**

With the beginning of school my life became divided into two parts: Field Hockey and School. Of course, I spent a lot of time with my friends, running through the forest, going on 'adventures' and basically trying to spend as much time outside as one could, but I guess at the time that was something many children used to do. In Field Hockey I was terrible, my parents even thought about changing of sports once, but I enjoyed it and eventually would actually become a reasonably good player, but more about that later. I started going to a small school in my village, but transferred over to an English speaking school in 4th Grade, as my parents wanted me to learn English. 

**3. Who is Warren Buffett?**

Until I was 8 years old, life was about sport, school and friends. There were no other responsibilities and I don't recall thinking about anything else. It was when I was 8 years old that I read a newsletter my dad received on a weekly basis. It was written by a German Investor who recommended stocks and I immediately became hooked by the concept of investing money in companies. Beginning to read myself, I quickly came across an investor named Warren Buffett and the way he spoke, what he said and what he did completely aligned with my personality. I purchased my first stock in that same year and have spent a lot of time since, looking at companies, reading into investing and just trying to get a better investor. I have linked one of my favorite books on Investing here: [Link](https://www.amazon.com/100-Stock-Market-Distinguished-Opportunities/dp/1626540292/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1ZAG19MG15BNE&dchild=1&keywords=100+to+1+in+the+stock+market&qid=1598779810&sprefix=100+to+1+%2Caps%2C466&sr=8-1)

Here is a short list of other books I enjoyed: 

* 'Commonn Stocks and Uncommon Profits' - Philip Fisher
* 'The Dhando Investor' - Mohnish Pabrai
* 'Die Kunst, über Geld nachzudenken' - André Kostolany

**4. Academics or Sport**

I was nominated into the German National Hockey Team when I was 15 years old. It was maybe the biggest achievement in my life so far, but unfortunately it did not last very long. I got injured 4 months later and spent the next 6 months in rehab and trying to get back onto the field again. However, at the same time I had made up certain plans for where I wanted to study and what I wanted to do after school. I knew that I would never be able to live from playing Field Hockey and so I decided not to continue playing for the National Team and began enjoying the last few years of Field Hockey as a Hobby. Here is an older image of my team in Frankfurt:

**5. A German in Milan**

After school I decided to study Economics and Finance in Milan, Italy. It was an incredible experience and it allowed me to develop academically and personally in ways I would not have imagined. I  fell in love with the southern European culture, the way of life, the food and the weather. Best of all, I fell in love with a wonderful girl. 

**5. Now**

So this was a short overview of some parts of my life I felt belong into a biography about myself. I can't wait to add more experiences and I'm really looking forward to my time in London and especially my time at London Business School.
