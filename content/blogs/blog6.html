title: Gapminder Analysis
---



<p>I will use the gapminder dataset to produce two graphs of how life expectancy has changed over the years for the <code>country</code> and the <code>continent</code> I come from (Germany)</p>
<p>First, I create two datasets regarding the continent and country of origin.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>country_data &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% 
            filter(country == &quot;Germany&quot;) 

continent_data &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% 
            filter(continent == &quot;Europe&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then I create a plot of life expectancy over time for Germany. I use <code>geom_point()</code> to see the actual data points and <code>geom_smooth(se = FALSE)</code> to plot the underlying trendlines.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot1 &lt;- ggplot(country_data, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
geom_point() +
geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
NULL 

plot1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/blog6_files/figure-html/lifeExp_one_country-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Next I add a title using the labs function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot1 &lt;- ggplot(country_data, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
geom_point() +
geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
labs(title = &quot;Life Expectancy in Germany from 1952-2007&quot;,
x = &quot;Year&quot;,
y = &quot;Life Expectancy in years&quot;) +
NULL

print(plot1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/blog6_files/figure-html/lifeExp_one_country_with_label-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>After that I produce a plot for all countries in the <em>continent</em> I come from.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot2 &lt;- ggplot(continent_data, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, colour = country))+
geom_point() + 
geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
labs(title = &quot;Life Expectancy in Europe from 1952-2007&quot;,
x = &quot;Year&quot;,
y = &quot;Life Expectancy in years&quot;) +
NULL

plot2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/blog6_files/figure-html/lifeExp_one_continent-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Finally, using the original <code>gapminder</code> data, I produce a life expectancy over time graph, grouped (or faceted) by continent. I remove all legends, adding the <code>theme(legend.position="none")</code> in the end of the ggplot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot3 &lt;- ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, colour = continent))+
geom_point() + 
geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + 
labs(title = &quot;Life Expectancy by continent from 1952-2007&quot;,
x = &quot;Year&quot;,
y = &quot;Life Expectancy in years&quot;) +
facet_wrap(~continent) +
theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) + 
NULL

plot3</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>

<p>We can see that life expectancy has increased in each continent since 1952. Nevertheless, there were and still are significant differences in life expectancy levels across continents. In 1952, people living in Oceania had the highest life expectancy and people living in Africa had the lowest. In 2007, this was unchanged. Africa still has the lowest life expectancy levels of all continents and Oceania the highest. There are probably multiple reasons for why the life expectancy levels were different, have been evolved differently and are still different, but it can be assumed that three main reasons are economic development, social and political unrest and general infrastructure, all of which are of course intertwined with one another.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Development</strong></p>
<p>Nutrition, standards of living and education have a large impact on life expectancy levels in a given country and continent. It is difficult to assess all of these factors quantitatively, but it is not unreasonable to assume that they are in some way positively correlated to the income of each citizen and the wealth of a country as a whole. The income of people determines the quality and quantity of their nutrition, the standards of living and the education families are able to provide to their children. The wealth of the nation determines the upper and lower boundaries within which people can increase or lower their standards of living. If there are no private schools for example, money is useless when it comes to the provision of an improved education for a child. The above graph shows that America, Asia, Europe and Oceania, even though starting at higher levels of life expectancy than Africa have managed to increase their advantage further. Although Africa has also managed to increase its life expectancy levels (though this improvement has almost been halted for the last 20 years) the continent did not manage to catch up with the rest of the world. One reason for this could be the differences in economic development levels from 1952-2007. Africa has by far experienced the lowest levels of economic development when measured on a per capita basis in this time period as can be seen in the graph below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot4 &lt;- ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap, colour = continent))+
geom_point() + 
geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + 
labs(title = &quot;GDP Per Capita Development of each country by continent from 1952-2007&quot;,
x = &quot;Year&quot;,
y = &quot;GDP Per Capita&quot;) +
facet_wrap(~continent) +
theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) + 
NULL

plot4</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>

<p>In addition, life expectancy levels have remained flat in Africa starting around 1990 until 2007. One reason for this could have been the social and political instability in the continent.</p>
<p><strong>Social and Political Instability</strong></p>
<p>Social and Political unrest can cause a country to enter into warfare, move capital into segments that are less beneficial for the standards of living for citizens, cause psychological and physical pain as well as putting a country or a nation into a coma where there is no development, both economically and with respect to the life expectancy of people. Although there has been political and social upheavals in America, Asia, Oceania and Europe, they seem to not have affected the longer trend of an increasing life expectancy in each continent. However, there is one point in time (in the 1990’s), where the increase in life expectancy in Africa suddenly stops. One event, which coincided with this halt is the end of Apartheid in South and Southwest Africa. At first it was a period of high uncertainty, social imbalance and economic standstill. For the 20 years to follow, countries such as South Africa and Zimbabwe saw a very strong decrease in economic development, which could explain partly why the life expectancy levels stopped increasing. But there is one other possible factor worth mentioning, namely the Infrastructure a country has.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>Especially with regards to life expectancy one relevant factor to consider is the availability and quality of healthcare. A country and a continent with low healthcare standards will not allow for its people to live beyond a certain age. In Africa, where there is a combination of lower quality infrastructure, low quantities of skilled labor in the healthcare system to provide for all people (doctors) and the presence of deadly diseases (Ebola, AIDS, Malaria, etc.) this factor is very relevant when considering the fact that Africa’s life expectancy levels have not been able to increase starting in 1990 until 2007. Capital, education and nutrition can affect the standards of living of individuals within a country given its respective infrastructure. Countries in continents such as Europe, America and Oceania have in the majority of cases had higher quality infrastructure in the past (1952-2007) than Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>There are many reasons for the different developments of life expectancy levels across the continents. Some factors may be economic development, social and political stability and infrastructure. But there are many more and the factors are all interconnected. Overall, it can be said that Europe, Oceania, America and Asia started at higher levels of life expectancy than Africa and Africa has been unable to catch up. Even though countries in all continents experienced times of economic hardship, political and social instability and there may be different levels of infrastructure across all countries in all continents, the combination of slow to no economic development, a lower quality infrastructure and significant political and social instability in the African countries may be a significant reason for why the countries in Africa have experienced low to no positive development with regards to the life expectancy of its inhabitants. On the other hand, countries in Europe, America, Asia and Oceania have significantly prospered economically, on average, from 1952-2007. They were able to reinvest into healthcare systems, education, high quality provision of nutrition and others and have on average managed to increase their life expectancy levels continuously from 1952-2007.</p>
