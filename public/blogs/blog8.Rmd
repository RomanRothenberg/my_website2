I will analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but I am only interested in very few of these variables and will thus only use a smaller file.

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("static", "data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
```

Sidenote: I noticed that many responses should not be taken into consideration, such as "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer" and have thus not considered these in my analysis. 

I will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables I have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

At first, I want to find out the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016.

To do this, I have to solve for certain variables and perform calculations, as presented below. 

I create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. 

```{r, nap_insta, cache=TRUE}

gss2 <- gss %>% 
mutate(snap_insta = case_when(snapchat == "Yes" ~ "Yes", 
                              instagrm == "Yes" ~ "Yes", is.na(snapchat) & 
                                is.na(instagrm) ~ "NA_character_",
                              snapchat == "No" & instagrm == "No" ~ "No"))               
  
```

Then I calculated the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.

```{r, nap_insta2, cache=TRUE}

proportion_users <- gss2 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(snap_insta)) %>% 
  summarise( 
    InstaSnap_Users = count(snap_insta == "Yes"),
    Non_Users = count(snap_insta == "No"),
    Proportion = InstaSnap_Users/ (InstaSnap_Users + Non_Users)
    )

proportion_users
  
```

Using the CI formula for proportions, I construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram

```{r, nap_insta3, cache=TRUE}

proportion_users_gender <- gss2 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(snap_insta)) %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(
    InstaSnap_Users = count(snap_insta == "Yes"),
    Non_Users = count(snap_insta == "No"),
    Count = n(),
    Proportion = InstaSnap_Users/ (InstaSnap_Users + Non_Users)
    )

proportion_users_gender  # proportion - proportion_yes / count of original value

proportions_gender_ci <- proportion_users_gender %>% 
  summarise(
    proportion = Proportion,
    size = Count,
    SE = sqrt((proportion*(1-proportion))/size),
    tcritical = qt(0.975, size-1),
    lower_ci = proportion - tcritical*SE,
    upper_ci = proportion + tcritical*SE
  )

proportions_gender_ci
  
```

It is interesting to see that women are heavier users of Instagram and Snapchat than men. Even when considering a 95% confidence interval, do the two gender groups not intersect, so we can clearly say that we expect to see that in the overall population women use Instagram and Snapchat more than men. 

## Email usage

Also, I want to estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on emails weekly.

To do this, I first create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on emails weekly.

```{r, nap_email1, cache=TRUE}

email <- gss %>%
  mutate_at(vars(emailhr,emailmin), funs(as.numeric)) %>% 
  mutate(email=(emailhr*60)+emailmin) %>% 
  arrange(desc(email))

```

I want to visualize the distribution of this new variable, so I also find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on emails weekly. 

```{r, nap_email2, cache=TRUE}

summary_email <- email %>%
   na.omit(email) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(email), 
            median = median(email)) 

summary_email

ggplot(email, aes(y=email)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="US Adults spend more than 100 Minutes on Emails a Week!",
       y="Email Minutes"
       )

```

Using the `infer` package, I calculated a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. 

I interpreted this interval in the context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes).

```{r, nap_email3, cache=TRUE}

bootstrap_email_ci <- email %>% 
  specify(response = email) %>% 
  generate(reps = 100, type="bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean") %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile") %>% 
  mutate(lower_ci = lower_ci/60, upper_ci = upper_ci/60) # transform from min into h + min as decimal

bootstrap_email_ci

```

It is shocking to see how much time we spend on emails and communicating with each other. The confidence interval for the mean email usage in the population is between 6hrs 24min and 7hrs 28min. I wonder how this has changed over the past and whether there might be some psychological trends that could be explained with the ever increasing fixation humanity has to social media.
