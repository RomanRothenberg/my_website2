Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. As a little exercise I will try to look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. 

First, I will use the `tidyquant` package to download monthly rates for different durations. (This excersice was done with a little help from my Data Analytics Professor - Thank you Kostis!)

```{r get_rates, warning=FALSE}
# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency
# to see, eg., the 3-month T-bill https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS
tickers <- c('TB3MS', # 3-month Treasury bill (or T-bill)
             'TB6MS', # 6-month
             'GS1',   # 1-year
             'GS2',   # 2-year, etc....
             'GS3',
             'GS5',
             'GS7',
             'GS10',
             'GS20',
             'GS30')  #.... all the way to the 30-year rate

# Turn  FRED codes to human readable variables
myvars <- c('3-Month Treasury Bill',
            '6-Month Treasury Bill',
            '1-Year Treasury Rate',
            '2-Year Treasury Rate',
            '3-Year Treasury Rate',
            '5-Year Treasury Rate',
            '7-Year Treasury Rate',
            '10-Year Treasury Rate',
            '20-Year Treasury Rate',
            '30-Year Treasury Rate')

maturity <- c('3m', '6m', '1y', '2y','3y','5y','7y','10y','20y','30y')

# by default R will sort these maturities alphabetically; but since I want
# to keep them in that exact order, I recast maturity as a factor 
# or categorical variable, with the levels defined as we want
maturity <- factor(maturity, levels = maturity)

# Create a lookup dataset
mylookup<-data.frame(symbol=tickers,var=myvars, maturity=maturity)
# Take a look:
mylookup %>% 
  knitr::kable()

df <- tickers %>% tidyquant::tq_get(get="economic.data", 
                   from="1960-01-01")   # start from January 1960

glimpse(df)
glimpse(mylookup)
```

The dataframe `df` has three columns (variables):

- `symbol`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `date`: already a date object
- `price`: the actual yield on that date

The first thing would be to join this dataframe `df` with the dataframe `mylookup` so I have a more readable version of maturities, durations, etc.


```{r join_data, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <-left_join(df,mylookup,by="symbol") 
```

## Plotting the yield curve

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r yield_curve_1, out.width="100%"}

#Before I start, I need to change the variable 'var' to a factor, such that the graphs will be displayed in the right order
#I create a new variable 'neworder' with the correct order
neworder <- c("3-Month Treasury Bill",
              "6-Month Treasury Bill",
              "1-Year Treasury Rate", 
              "2-Year Treasury Rate",
              "3-Year Treasury Rate",
              "5-Year Treasury Rate", 
              "7-Year Treasury Rate",
              "10-Year Treasury Rate",
              "20-Year Treasury Rate",
              "30-Year Treasury Rate")

#And additionally create a new variable 'yield_curve2' with the transformed variable 'var'
yield_curve2 <- arrange(transform(yield_curve,
             var=factor(var,levels=neworder)),var)

#I use the dataset 'yield_curve2' 
ggplot(yield_curve2,
       
#and map the variable 'price' (yield) over time ('date'), coloring by 'var' so that each type of bond will be displayed in a different color
      aes(x = date, y = price, color = var)) +

#I plot a geom_line
      geom_line() + 
  
#And facet_wrap by 'var' making the number of columns equal to 2
      facet_wrap(~var, ncol = 2) +

#I choose the black and white theme as in the presented graphic and get rid of the legend
      theme_bw() +
      theme(legend.position = "none") +
  
#At last I label our graph and give the source in the bottom right corner
      labs(

        x= "",
        y="%",
        caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")

### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis


```{r yield_curve_2, out.width="100%"}

#Before I start, I create a new dataset
yield_curve3 <- yield_curve2 %>%

  mutate(year = year(date)) %>% 
  
#And filter the dataset for the variables that have been recorded after 1999.
  filter(year >= 1999)


#I use the dataset 'yield_curve3' to plot a ggplot
ggplot(yield_curve3, 

#Grouping by date as to allow the lines to span across maturities for each month, I map 'price' over 'maturity' and color by year 
      aes(group = date, x = maturity, y = price, color = year)) +

#I plot a geom_line
      geom_line() +

#And facet_wrap by year, customizing the number of columns to 4
      facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 4) +

#I choose the theme and get rid of the legend for aesthetic purposes
      theme_bw() +
      theme(legend.position = "none") +

#At last I label our graph and give the source in the bottom right corner
      labs(

        x= "Maturity",
        y="Yield (%)",
        caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")

### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r yield_curve_3, out.width="100%"}

#For this exercise I create a new varible 'yield_curve4'
yield_curve4 <- yield_curve %>%

#Next I summarize for date, symbol, price and year, the variables required
  summarize(date = date,
            symbol = symbol, 
            price = price,
            year = year) %>% 
  
#I pivot_wider the symbols and take the values from price
  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = price) %>%

#I create a new varibale reorder with the right structure of bonds
reorder <- c("3-Month Treasury Bill",

#And rearrange the formerly created dataset according to the new order
yield_curve4 <- arrange(transform(yield_curve4,

According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?


Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things I need to do to produce our final plot

```{r, out.width="100%"}
#First I calculate the monthly average spread
#To do this I first need to add a column with the daily spread / Pivot wider by date so that symbol x and y are columns and prices are below / difference can be calculated


#First I create a new dataset yield_curve5 from yield_curve2
yield_curve5 <- yield_curve2 %>% 
  
#I summarize the date, symbol and price to get the relevant data
  summarize(date = date,
            symbol = symbol, 
            price = price) %>% 
  
#Then, I pivot_wider using the symbols and taking the values from prices
  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = price) %>% 
  
#I summarize the relevant variables
  summarize(date = date, 
            tbill = TB3MS,
            treasury = GS10) 

#Next, I calculate the yield_curve_spread taking the data from yield_curve5
yield_curve_spread <- yield_curve5 %>% 
  
#I add another column for the year and calculate the spread by subtracting treasury - tbill
          mutate(year = year(date), 
                 spread = treasury - tbill, 
                 
#For the ribbons we calculate a max and a min relevant to the spread
                 max = if_else(spread>0, spread, 0),
                 min = if_else(spread<0,spread, 0))


#I setup data for the recessions to superimpose them on the graph later
#Geting the data for US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

         duration_days = To-From,
         year = year(From)) %>% 
  filter(year > 1959)


#Then I create a new ggplot called yield_curve_inversion using the dataset yield_curve_spread
yield_curve_inversion <-  ggplot(yield_curve_spread) + 

#I plot the spread over time using geom_line
                          geom_line(aes(x = date, y = spread)) +

#Then, I geom_ribbon for coloring the parts above 0 and below 0 in 2 different colors
